# GHLA

Something a level higher than Assembly.

## Features

GHLA extends Assembly with these optional features:

- shorten syscalls
- append string length
- syscall constants (SYSCALL_WRITE, SYSCALL_OPEN, etc.)

## ToDo

All of things here shall be a `feature` that can be turned on, but it isn't by default.

- namespaces
- better ifs
- printf
- better variables
- shorten function calls
- better for-loop and while-loop
